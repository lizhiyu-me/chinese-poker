# Chinese Poker
>This repo is mainly about the rule logic of Chinese poker, and it is not just for classic Chinese poker, but for the poker you want to customize.

**Just config in file <code>src/Config.ts</code> with no logic code change.**

Test your customize rule with [jest](https://jestjs.io/):
- modify <code>src/__tests__/ruler_spec.ts</code>as you want.
- run <code>npm run test </code> at rootDir to check the results.
